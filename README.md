# MISSION MARS BDD TEST PROJECT

A squad of robotic rovers are to be landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars. This plateau, which is curiously rectangular, must be navigated by the rovers so that their on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

This sample test project was created for testing navigation functionalities of the robotic rover over the planet Mars. 

# Key Features

- BDD approach with Cucumber & Gherkin DSL
- Java 15.0.1
- Build Maven
- JUnit & TestNG
- Extent Report pdf & html


# Covered functional test scenarios

  Feature:  <br />
  Navigation of the robotic rover to the left right forward and back directions

  Description:  <br />
  As a robotic rover controller,  <br />
  I would like to send navigation commands to the rover,  <br />
  So that I can control it and capture videos of the planet mars.

- The rover should be able to turn left
- The rover should be able to turn right
- The rover should be able to move forward
- The rover should be able to move back
- The rover should be able to turn back over the right hand side
- The rover should be able to turn back over the left hand side
- The rover should be able to navigate to a given location
- The rover should be able to process a multiple navigation command sequentially
- The rover should be able to process a series of single navigation commands sequentially
